# K-armed bandit, crossentropy
Here I have tested k-armed bandit problem and crossentropy-algorithm
with small NN consisting of several Dense-layers.

The crossentropy-algorithm is "cross_entropy_cart_pole.py".

Here I sampled 10000 times actions and rewards of openAI gym "cartpole-v0" and then
trained them usign keras NN.
