# Here I am exploring Reinforcement Learning algorithms

The books I have use for self studying are:
 - RL book
 - Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-on, Maxim Lapan

My first experiments are done by means of openAI

```python
import gym
env = gym.make('CartPole-v0')
```
etc

The experiments where I have tested only basics of RL-algorithms are in the folde K_armed_bandit.
